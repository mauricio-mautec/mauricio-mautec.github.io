![Me](https://mauricio-mautec.github.io/about/me.jpeg)

**Live to Code, Code to Live**

I enjoy hacking/optimizing systems and code software at daily basis. My interests are very broad regarding languages and hardware.

C/C++ are the languages that I've written most lines of code and I'm currently working as back end developer focused in food market.

When coding in Linux I use vim, makefiles and git.

I have software written on Windows in C++ and Delphi using embarcadero's RAD Studio.

My primary computer is a mac and I like spending time in Xcode compiling software for iOS.

Love Python, Arduino and the likes, RaspBery Pi and make IOT devices with them!
